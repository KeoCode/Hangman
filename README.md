## Testing 

- I Have added all Form fields as a requirement as all data is needed to make accurate calculations, I also have added a minimum length and a max length to certain fields to ensure it will validate that the correct data is entered inte right field.

- I had commented out the console log's in my code but i reguarly use the to double check the formula's are correct.

- The Screen is responsive as can be seen here in the AmIREsponsive screen shots on all tested devices.
